# NodeApp Database Project

## Overview

**NodeApp** is a project developed as part of the Database course at the university. The primary goal of this project is to establish a connection with a travel orders database and present specific data in an efficient and user-friendly manner. The application is built using Node.js, allowing for seamless integration with the database and streamlined access to relevant information.

## Features

- **Database Connection:** NodeApp connects to the travel orders database, enabling the retrieval of essential data.
- **Data Presentation:** The application efficiently organizes and displays relevant information from the database.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for users interacting with the data.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- Access to the travel orders database
- Necessary credentials to establish a connection with the database

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmarOsmanovic/NodeApp.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd NodeApp-Database-Project
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Configure database connection:**

    Open the `.env` file in the project root and provide the necessary details:

    ```env
